## Description
**Settings:** Gemini 2.5 Flash  
**Temperature:** 1  
**Thinking mode:** On  
**Output length:** 65,536  
**Top P:** 0.95  

Files used: 36.json; strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.1.md  
Output JSON file: 2025-10-01-annotation-test-4_36.json

### Prompt 4
Annotate `36.json` based on the `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.1.md` file, thereafter generating a JSON file as the output. Note the child is 36 months and may have speech disfluencies based on that age. When analysing the dialogue, interpret utterances not only at the textual level but also in terms of real-world meaning — for example, recognise contextual references like people, objects, activities, and places in everyday life.

### Difference from Test 3
- **Thinking mode** was switched on.

## OUTPUT from Test 4

### Example 1
- Using **thinking mode** led to the question “it’s a color but what color is it green it’s green” in *Turn 13* being tagged with **“Thought-provoking_Questioning”** and **“Explain_Scaffold”** in Test 4 compared to **“Feedback_Scaffold”**, **“Information-seeking_Questioning”** and **“Explain_Scaffold”** in Test 3.  
- The absence of tag **“Feedback_Scaffold”** in Turn 13 in Test 4 (unlike in Test 3) could possibly indicate that the model was being more conservative in how it understood what it meant for the adult to be providing the child with feedback, based on strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.1.md

### Example 2
- Using **thinking mode** led to **“Explain_Scaffold”** not being tagged in *Turn 17* anymore.
- The model interpreted the turn:  
  *“where did you get this pail at did you eat at mcdonald's and get that it looks like it can you put anything in here look”*  
  differently than in Test 3.

### Example 3
- Using **thinking mode** led to **“Explain_Scaffold”** not being tagged in *Turn 21* in Test 4 (compared to its presence in Test 3):  
  *“yours is better this is yours though look can you watch this this is musical television hear it bax do you wanna get some more toys out do you do you”*  
  contains explanatory content.

### Notes
- In Test 4, turns 17 and 21 lacked the tag **“Explain_Scaffold”** compared to Test 3
- The main difference in settings was that **thinking mode** was enabled
