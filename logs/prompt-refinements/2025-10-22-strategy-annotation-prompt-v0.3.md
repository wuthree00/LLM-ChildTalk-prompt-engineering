## Refining the Prompt File

**File name**: strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.3.md

I made updates to the **strategy annotation prompt** file (**v0.3**) to clarify when specific scaffolds should be applied, and to refine the schema goal definitions for **Accretion**, **Tuning**, and **Restructuring**.

## Edits Made

### FEEDBACK SCAFFOLD

**Added:**

> Use this tag only when the adult’s utterance explicitly evaluates, confirms, or extends the child’s contribution (eg. “Yes, that’s right”, “Good thinking, you remembered!”). Do not use this tag for rhetorical fillers, or neutral follow-up comments that do not seek to confirm the correctness of new information, point out deviation in details, or reinforce logic after restructuring.

---

### MODEL SCAFFOLD

**Added:**

> Apply only when the adult demonstrates or performs an action or linguistic behavior for the child to imitate. Do not apply when the adult merely describes or mentions an action (eg. “patty cake” said without showing or mentioning that they are doing an action related to the utterance).

---

### SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL-SUPPORT SCAFFOLD

**Added:**

> Tag only when the utterance aims to regulate emotion, provide reassurance, or build rapport (eg. “That’s okay”, “Don’t worry, try again”). Do not tag short acknowledgements (“okay”, “yeah”) which could be interpreted as placeholders, unless they clearly soothe or encourage emotionally.

### SCHEMA GOALS

**New schema goal definitions (edits in bold):**

> **A (Accretion):** Adding new information **not previously mentioned**, attributes, or relationships to the child's existing cognitive schema. This represents the introduction of new knowledge that fits into the existing mental structure.

> **T (Tuning):** Refining an existing schema by clarifying ambiguities, correcting misunderstandings, or fine-tuning understanding. **Corrects, clarifies, or elaborates something already introduced.**

> **R (Restructuring):** Completely reorganizing the child's mental schema when there is a fundamental contradiction that requires a significant change in their knowledge structure. **Challenges or replaces an incorrect idea.**
