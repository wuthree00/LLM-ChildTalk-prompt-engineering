# 15 Oct 2025 – Test 5

## Description
**Model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash  
**Temperature:** 1  
**Thinking mode:** ON (5a) and OFF (5b)  
**Output length:** 65 536  
**Top P:** 0.95  

Files used:  
`36 (1 Bohannon_Bax_gina)_first100.json`, `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.2.md`

## Overview
I split `36.json` into five dialogue files (100 turns each) for targeted analysis. I ran the file `36 (1 Bohannon_Bax_gina)_first100.json` and compared `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.2.md` through Gemini 2.5 Flash twice, with thinking mode being on for the first and off for the second.
Two versions of the first 100 turns were run:

- **Test 5a: Thinking mode ON** (22 411 tokens)  
- **Test 5b: Thinking mode OFF** (12 653 tokens)

  
### Prompt 5
Annotate all turns in `36 (1 Bohannon_Bax_gina)_first100.json` based on the `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.2.md` file, thereafter generating a JSON file as the output. Note that the child is 36 months old and may have speech disfluencies typical of that age. When analysing the dialogue, interpret utterances not only at the textual level but also in terms of real-world meaning (eg. people, objects, activities, places). Return only the annotation results in valid JSON format following the structure specified in the guideline file.


## Comparison – Test 5a vs 5b (Thinking ON vs OFF)

### Overall Difference
- **5a** demonstrates stronger inferential reasoning – it interprets intent and pedagogical purpose rather than relying on surface syntax.  
- **5b** is more literal and structural – mainly identifies question form (eg. `Information-seeking_Questioning`) without grasping cognitive function.  
- **Summary:** Thinking mode enables the model to connect linguistic form with teaching intent but can lead to *over-tagging* with **`Feedback_Scaffold`**, as it tends to “over-read” the situation.


### Reasoning Depth
- **5a:** Infers *why* the adult’s utterance is made, for instance when the adult encourages or scaffolds the child’s reasoning
  - Adds tags like `Thought-provoking_Questioning` (Turns 11, 17) or `Feedback_Scaffold` (Turns 11, 13, 19, 57, 63).  
- **5b:** Ofen omits many inference-heavy tags, sticking to surface-level tags like `Information-seeking_Questioning` or `Instruct_Scaffold`.  
  - `Thought-provoking_Questioning` appears only in Turn 11.  
  - `Feedback_Scaffold` appears only in Turn 13.  
- **Example:** Turn 11 in 5b lacks `Feedback_Scaffold`, losing the reinforcing nuance (by the adult) captured in 5a.


### Schema Goal Classification (A / T / R)

| Code | Meaning | Observation |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **A** | Adding new information to the child’s schema | Both tests label basic fact-giving turns as A, but 5b over-applies A even when refinement is occurring. |
| **T** | Refining an existing schema; clarifying or correcting understanding | 5a correctly increases T labels (Turns 11, 13, 15). 5b often mislabels these as A. |
| **R** | Major reorganisation of the child’s mental schema | Rare in both, but 5a occasionally identifies R when the adult challenges a misconception; 5b never does. |

**Result:** Thinking mode improves discrimination between A and T, showing deeper awareness of conceptual refinement processes.


### Cognitive Alignment Level
- **5a:** Distinguishes *partial* vs *full* alignment with nuance.  
  - Turn 12 could be recognised as partial alignment, which the model did in test 5a.
  - Disalign: 10, 12, 16, 32, 40, 42, 50, 88.  
- **5b:** Overuses `disalign`, treating every divergence as misalignment.  
  - Disalign: 10, 16, 22, 32, 40, 42, 50, 66, 80, 82, 88.  
  - Turn 22 could be considered having *partial* alignment but was marked as disaligned.  
  - Turn 66 mis-tagged as disalign instead of partial.  
  - Turns 80 and 82 however could be considered as disaligned, which the model rightly used (missing from 5a).

**Summary:** 5a shows finer discrimination in alignment tagging.


### Strategy Tag Differences

#### General Pattern
- **Thinking mode (5a)** produced richer and more varied tag combinations, identifying multiple communicative functions per utterance.
- However, this led to *some over-tagging* (eg. extra `Confirmation_Questioning` tag in Turn 1).

#### Notable Differences
- **More nuanced understanding of question types:**  
  - **Turn 13:** “it’s a color but what color is it green it’s green” → 5a recognised `Thought-provoking_Questioning`; 5b only `Information-seeking_Questioning`.  
  - **Turn 37:** “what kind of car is that is that knight rider like a kit car” → 5a tagged as guided questioning; 5b as `Confirmation_Questioning`.  
- **More frequent use of `"Feedback_Scaffold"` and `"Thought-provoking_Questioning"`:**  
  - `"Feedback_Scaffold"` appears 5 times in 5a but only once in 5b (Turn 13).  
  - `"Thought-provoking_Questioning"` appears twice in 5a but once in 5b.  
  - The more frequent use of these tags in 5a suggests that thinking mode helped the model detect implicit scaffolding intent. However, some cases (eg. Turn 63) may have been overclassified with `Feedback_Scaffold`.
  - Turn 11: 5a adds `Feedback_Scaffold` alongside `Explain_Scaffold`, `Instruct_Scaffold`, `Thought-provoking_Questioning`; 5b has only the latter three → could indicate that the thinking model is more attuned to subtle instructional and guiding strategies, or shows richer interpretive depth in 5a.


### “Model_Scaffold” Usage
- Appears much more frequently in 5a: While `Model_Scaffold` appears in both files, the thinking model uses it more frequently in 5a.
- **5a:** Appears 5 times (often alone) vs **5b:** once.
- In 5a, it usually appears as the **sole tag**. For the one time it appeared with another tag (Turn 77), it was incorrectly tagged as the adult wasn’t demonstrating examples of new behaviours.  
  - **Turn 77:** “hum patty cake patty cake baker's man you don't like that one”  
    - **Test 5a:** `"Model_Scaffold"`, `"Confirmation_Questioning"` → **WRONG**  
    - **Test 5b:** `"Explain_Scaffold"`, `"Confirmation_Questioning"` → **correct**  
- **Point:** `Model_Scaffold` was overused in 5a (five instances vs one in 5b) and often incorrectly. Thinking model used in 5a tends to over-interpret demonstrative intent when there isn't.


### “Social-emotional-support” Tag
- Appears 11 times in 5a but 3 in 5b.  
- Common turns: 27, 29, 75 → likely tagged correctly.  
- Tagged in 5a only (not 5b):  
  - **Turn 21:** “yours is better this is yours though look can you watch this ...” → possibly valid social-emotional support.  
  - **Turn 87:** “okay turn the page” → **wrongly tagged**.  
  - **Turn 101:** “nan” → this might not be providing emotional or social support.


## Summary of Findings
1. **Thinking mode (5a)** → richer semantic and pedagogical interpretationm sometimes over-reading the utterance.  
2. **Non-thinking mode (5b)** → simpler, structural classification, sometimes too literal.
3. **Improvements:** Better distiction between A and T, and correct tagging of schema goals in 5a.  
4. **Weaknesses:** Over-tagging of `Feedback_Scaffold`, `Model_Scaffold`, and `Social-emotional-support` in 5a.  
5. **Learning points:** Thinking mode enhances conceptual depth but requires stricter tag boundaries to avoid the overuse of tags, possibly due to an over-reading of utterances.
