## 22 Oct 2025 – Test 6  ##

### **Settings**  
- **Model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash  
- **Temperature:** 1  
- **Thinking mode:** On  
- **Grounding:** Google Search On  
- **Output length:** 65536  
- **Top P:** 0.95  
- **Files used:** 36 (1 Bohannon_Bax_gina)_first100.json, strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.3.md  


### **Prompt**  
Annotate all turns in `36 (1 Bohannon_Bax_gina)_first100.json` based on the `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.3.md` file, thereafter generating a JSON file as the output. Note that the child is 36 months old and may have speech disfluencies typical of that age. When analysing the dialogue, interpret utterances not only at the textual level but also in terms of real-world meaning (eg. people, objects, activities, places). Return only the annotation results in valid JSON format, following the structure specified in the guideline file. When analysing, avoid over-tagging: assign only those `strategy_tags` that are clearly evidenced by the utterance’s communicative intent. Pay special attention to distinguishing **A (adding new information)** from **T (refining an existing idea)**, and tag **R** only when the adult explicitly reorganises the child’s understanding.  


### **Goal**  
To counter the overuse of tags, specifically `feedback_scaffold`, `model_scaffold`, and `social-emotional-support_scaffold`, and refine the schema goal tagging (A, T, R) of the adult’s utterance.  


### **Summary of Changes Made in Test 6**  
- Explicit instructions to avoid the overuse of tags were added in the prompt.  
- Explicit instructions to avoid the overuse of `feedback_scaffold`, `model_scaffold`, and `social-emotional-support_scaffold` tags were added in `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.3.md`.  
- Schema goals were refined and made more explicit.  


### **Elaboration of Changes Made in This Test**  

**Changes made in `strategy_annotation_prompt_v0.3.md`:**  

**Added under `feedback_scaffold`:**  
> Use this tag only when the adult’s utterance explicitly evaluates, confirms, or extends the child’s contribution (eg. “Yes, that’s right”, “Good thinking, you remembered!”).  
> Do not use this tag for rhetorical fillers, or neutral follow-up comments that do not seek to confirm the correctness of new information, point out deviation in details, or reinforce logic after restructuring.  

**Added under `model_scaffold`:**  
> Apply only when the adult demonstrates or performs an action or linguistic behavior for the child to imitate.  
> Do not apply when the adult merely describes or mentions an action (eg. “patty cake” said without showing or mentioning that they are doing an action related to the utterance).  

**Added under `social-emotional-support_scaffold`:**  
> Tag only when the utterance aims to regulate emotion, provide reassurance, or build rapport (eg. “That’s okay”, “Don’t worry, try again”).  
> Do not tag short acknowledgements (“okay”, “yeah”) which could be interpreted as placeholders, unless they clearly soothe or encourage emotionally.  

**New schema goal definitions – edits in bold:**  

- **A (Accretion):** Adding new information not previously mentioned, attributes, or relationships to the child's existing cognitive schema. This represents the introduction of new knowledge that fits into the existing mental structure.  
- **T (Tuning):** Refining an existing schema by clarifying ambiguities, correcting misunderstandings, or fine-tuning understanding. Corrects, clarifies, or elaborates something already introduced.  
- **R (Restructuring):** Completely reorganizing the child's mental schema when there is a fundamental contradiction that requires a significant change in their knowledge structure. Challenges or replaces an incorrect idea.  


### **Analysis of Test 6 Output**  

#### **Differences in Strategy Tags**

**Use of `Feedback_Scaffold`**  
- Appears **5 times** in Test 5a but **3 times** in Test 6.  
- `Thought-provoking_Questioning` appears twice in Test 5a but once in Test 6.  
- In Test 6, `Feedback_Scaffold` no longer appears in **turn 63**, where it could possibly have been overclassified in Test 5a.  

**Use of `Model_Scaffold`**  
- Appears **5 times** in Test 5a but **once** in Test 6.  
- The one instance in Test 6 was incorrectly tagged for the utterance **“boom” (turn 25)**.  
- **Turn 77:** “hum patty cake patty cake baker's man you don't like that one”  
  - Test 5a: `"Model_Scaffold", "Confirmation_Questioning"` → **WRONG**  
  - Test 6: `"Explain_Scaffold", "Confirmation_Questioning"` → **Correct**  

**Use of `Social-emotional-support_Scaffold`**  
- **Turn 21:** “yours is better this is yours though look can you watch this this is musical television hear it bax do you wanna get some more toys out do you do you”  
  - Tagged with `Social-emotional-support_Scaffold` in both 5a and 6.  
  - Additionally tagged with `Explain_Scaffold` in 6 → **[more accurate]**  
- **Turn 87:** “okay turn the page”  
  - Wrongly tagged with `Social-emotional-support_Scaffold` in 5a → **removed in 6 [improvement].**  
  - Gained an additional `Feedback_Scaffold` tag in 6.  
- **Turn 101:** “nan”  
  - Tagged with `Social-emotional-support_Scaffold` in 5a but **not in 6 [improvement].**
