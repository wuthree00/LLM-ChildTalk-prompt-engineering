# LLM-Based Annotation of Child-Adult Dialogues
Code repo for benchmarking interactions between child and adult.

This repository contains my personal notes and examples from my work with PhD students Jing and Siqi on the prompt engineering project analysing interactions between children and their adult caregivers.

This project explores how Large Language Models respond to conversational, pragmatic, and discourse-level meaning in naturally occurring child–adult interactions. It involves:

- Using prompt engineering to refine model's annotation  
- LLMs' data annotation of scaffolding strategies and question types present in adult's utterances, cognitive alignment level of child's response
- Challenges in modelling conversational context
- Iterative refinements made to prompts
- Comparison of annotation consistency across prompt designs  

The repository includes:
- Notes on model behaviour with each iteration  
- Comparison analysis
- Refinements made to prompts  
- Evaluation of the model's annotation of each dialogue  

This is a work in progress as I continue learning Python/NLP and expanding the project.
